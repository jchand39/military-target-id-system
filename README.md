# Target Identification Assistance System

### Military Vehicle Classification Using Feature-Based Machine Learning

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project implements a feature-engineered machine learning pipeline to classify military and civilian vehicles based on image data. Inspired by the operational needs of military aviation, the system prioritizes **explainability**, **robustness**, and **mission-relevant decision support**.

As a **Combat Systems Officer (CSO) 12X selectee**, I developed this project to explore how interpretable machine learning models can aid rapid, trustworthy target identification in degraded operational environments.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Extract visual features (e.g., edge density, color histograms, contrast) from vehicle images.
- Convert images into a tabular dataset for classical machine learning models.
- Train interpretable models (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, YOLO) to classify/Detect vehicles.
- Simulate challenging conditions (blur, noise) to test robustness.
- Emphasize explainability through feature analysis and confusion matrices.
